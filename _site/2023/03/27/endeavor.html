    <h1>A New Endeavor</h1>
<p>27 Mar 2023 - Noah</p>

<p>Starting a new project is always daunting. The weight of your own expectations makes it difficult for the project to ever take off.</p>

<p>I started this website basically to prove to myself that I can; I donâ€™t need a the rigorous structure of a university course or homework in order to make me do something productive and worthwhile. I want to show myself and the world that I am capable, that I can build something from the ground-up; that I can figure things out, learn from mistakes, and create something beautiful. Plus if I ever want to do freelance data science or programming work, I think it would be a good idea to have my own portfolio.</p>
